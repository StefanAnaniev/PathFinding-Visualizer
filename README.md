# Pathfinding Visualizer

## Usage:
Run the program
Initiliaze the start and end node
Add blocked nodes (black squares) if you want, after you initiliazed the start and end node.
You can erase any node by right clicking on it
After you initiliazed the board press Space so that every node can locate his neighbors
Now the board is ready for the visualization of the algorithm
